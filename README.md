# 🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors (C#)

A clean, lightweight implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. This project serves as a practical demonstration of core C# programming concepts, available as a console-based or Windows Forms application.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a foundational template for beginners and developers looking to brush up on logic-based programming in .NET. The game pits a human player against a computer opponent that makes randomized selections.



## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Interactive Input:** Handles user selections via console input or UI buttons.
* **AI Logic:** A randomized engine that ensures the computer's moves are unpredictable.
* **Win/Loss Evaluation:** A robust conditional system to determine game outcomes.
* **Replayability:** Implementation of loops to allow for multiple rounds without restarting the app.

## 💻 Technical Concepts Covered

The project highlights the following C# fundamentals:

| Concept | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Random Class** | Used to generate the computer's move ($0, 1, 2$). |
| **Conditionals** | `if-else` and `switch` statements for win/tie logic. |
| **Data Types** | Working with `strings`, `integers`, and `enums`. |
| **Validation** | Ensuring user input matches the expected game moves. |

## ⚙️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/raymondoyondi/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git](https://github.com/raymondoyondi/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in IDE:** Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.
3.  **Build & Run:** Press `F5` to compile and launch the application.

## 📝 Rules of the Game

1.  **Rock** beats Scissors.
2.  **Paper** beats Rock.
3.  **Scissors** beats Paper.
4.  If both players choose the same, it's a **Draw**.
